# picture_server

This is a simple example for practice in service usage and image transportation in ROS. It explains how to build a server that takes a picture from a camera. A publisher was created to send camera content continuously, and a server receives a command to take and save a picture.

It is recommended to see ROS beginner tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) before use it.
